*Research Interests*: /Robotics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning /\n\n 
I am a Master's student at /ECE Department/ at UC San Diego, where I am conducting research at /[https://www.ucsdarclab.com/ Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab (ARClab)]/ under the supervision of Prof. Michael Yip. 
Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from UC San Diego, and doing my undergraduate research at /[http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/ Statistical Visual Computing Laboratory (SVCL)]/. \n
Starting in 2019, I have also been closely collaborating with /[https://evt.ai/ Educational Vision Technologies (EVT)]/ in developing the online learning system using Machine Learning techniques. \n
My research interests lie in Computer Vision and Robotics. Currently, my research focus on solving perception problems for surgical robotics using deep learning techniques.
