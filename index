*Research Interests*: /Robotics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning /\n\n 
I am a research assistant at [https://www.ucsdarclab.com/ Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab (ARClab)] under the supervision of Prof. Michael Yip. 
I received my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from UC San Diego.
Previously, I worked on developing an image retrieval system for marine biological images using deep learning at [http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/ Statistical Visual Computing Laboratory (SVCL)]. \n
Starting in 2019, I have also been closely collaborating with [https://evt.ai/ Educational Vision Technologies (EVT)] in developing the online learning system using Machine Learning techniques. \n
I have a broad interest in Computer Vision, Robotics, and Machine Learning. Currently, my research focus on solving perception problems (tracking, reconstruction) for surgical robotics using deep learning techniques.
